# ZotLease

**What is this app about?**
The inspiration behind ZotLease was to tackle the housing challenges confronting thousands of UCI studentsâ€”aiming to enhance accessibility, affordability, and stress reduction in the housing process.

**What it does**
ZotLease is an all-encompassing website that simplifies subletting for UCI students. It enables users to effortlessly sublet their homes or discover suitable sublets, streamlining the entire housing process.

**How we built it**
ZotLease was crafted using a blend of front-end and back-end technologies. The website harnesses React, Chakra, CSS, Firebase, Express JS, Node JS, Melissa API, and Pigeon Map for secure authentication and built-in map navigation, ensuring a seamless experience for both subletters and those seeking housing.
